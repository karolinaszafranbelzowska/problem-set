Solution-8.py contains my solution to problem 8 - datetime.py , first I did
import datetime
print ('Current date/time: {}'.format(datetime.datetime.now())) 
but the format was not correct and finaly video below helped me to solve the problem
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDe8InbWQJU, 
Although I have the correct date and time format, I was unable to enter the appropriate suffixes (At this stage of my knowledge I don't know how to do it, but definately I will try to solve this problem in the nearest future)

Solution-9.py contains my solution to problem 9 - second.py  moby-dick.txt
It was the most difficult problem to solve for me. It took me a few days to finaly get the problem. At this time that's the only way I understand the command line argument.
